Registering A Discord API Application
=====================================

To use Dis4IRC, you will need a bot token from Discord API.

To get a bot token, you will need to register a new application.

Let's get started.


-------

Start by going to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers)
and logging in with your Discord account.

Next, on the main portal page, select the large "Create an application" placeholder.

Give your application a name that makes sense to you, I'll be using "Bridge".

If prompted, save your changes, then click the "Bot" tab in the sidebar on the left.

Select "Add bot" on the right side.

Give your bot a username, if you aren't using webhooks, you'll see this name a lot.

You can also give it an icon, if you aren't using webhooks you'll see this a lot too.

Now click the "Copy" button under the "Token" section. That is your bot's Discord API token that
you should paste into the config file.
